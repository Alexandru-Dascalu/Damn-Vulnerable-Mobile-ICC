    <string name="appExplanation">
        This app adds a country code to a dialed in number automatically. It will do it even when
        the app is not running. It should not do it if the number already has a country code, but if you
        see that it happens, set the country code in the app to an empty string.

        \n\nThe app will
        perform some validation on your input, but it is not perfect and does not guarantee that
        what you type is a valid country code. Do not to type in + before the code, as it is added
        automatically.
